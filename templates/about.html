        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin is portrayed as a medic to the company in the films. He is seen at different times in the films holding various bottles and jars. In these jars he supposedly keeps natural remedies and ointment (appropriately named after him). Later on in the second film he stays behind in Lake Town with an injured Kíli, having being pierced by a morgul shaft. When Thorin asks Óin to join him in coming to the Mountain, he says, "my duty lies with the wounded".

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin. He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
